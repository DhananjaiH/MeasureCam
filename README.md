MeasureCam
==========

Android application that uses the device camera to measure object dimensions.

The app uses basic principles of trigonometry for calculating the measures.

Given the height of the camera from the base of the object, this application can calculate the distance of the object from the user, height and length.

Steps for using the application:
1. Select the units of measurement required.
2. Input the height (approximate) of the camera from the base of the target object.
3. Click the 'Adjust Height' button
4. Point the marker at the base of the object, then select 'Get Distance' This will result in calculating the approximate distance of the object from the user.

At this point, the user can either find the height or length of the object, depending on need.

To calculate the height, point the marker at the top of the object, then select 'Get Height'

To find the length of the object, point the marker at one end of the target object, and then select 'Get Length' just ONCE. Now point the marker at the other end of the object and select 'Get length' again. This will give the horizontal length of the object.

Values can be reset by hitting the 'Reset' button.

Measurements can saved within the application.
The user can also choose to view previously saved measurements, or even delete some entries.
